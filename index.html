  <p><i>"His contributions to real-time computer graphics allowed for the creation of more complex games with rich details on early personal computers that lacked video cards and operated on MS-DOS. He is also credited as a catalyst for the explosive growth and evolution of the medium of gaming. As the innovator of the first-person shooter genre of computer games, Carmack devised ways to introduce smooth scrolling, raycasting, binary space partitioning (BSP) and Carmackâ€™s Reverse, a method named for Carmack himself." --Univerisity of Missouri-Kansas City</i></p>
